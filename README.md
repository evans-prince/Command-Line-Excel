# Command-Line Excel: Spreadsheet Project

**Author:** Prince\
**Start Date:** 01-Feb-2025

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is a command-line spreadsheet program developed in C, supporting integer-only cell values, formulas, and efficient recalculation using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). It mimics core functionalities of Excel such as cell assignment, formula evaluation, and dependency tracking, all within a terminal interface.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Spreadsheet Grid**: Supports sizes from 1x1 up to 999x18278 (A1 to ZZZ999).
- 🔗 **Formula Evaluation**: Supports arithmetic operations and range-based functions (e.g., `SUM(A1:A5)`).
- 🔄 **Efficient Recalculation**: Uses topological sorting and a calculation chain for updating only necessary cells.
- ♻️ **Dependency Management**: Tracks dependencies and dependents for each cell using CellRange structs.
- ⛔ **Error Handling**: Detects circular references, invalid inputs, and handles edge cases like division by zero.
- 🧪 **Testing Suite**: Modular unit tests for formula parsing, input handling, and recalculation.
- 🧱 **Modular Design**: Divided into reusable modules for better maintainability and scalability.

## 🛠️ Design Structure

### Spreadsheet Core

- `cell** grid`: 2D array for cells.
- `calculation_chain[]`: Optimized recalculation order.
- `CommandStatus`: Stores status and execution time of last command.

### Input Handling

- Tokenizes and classifies inputs using enums.
- Validates syntax for cell assignments, formulas, function calls, and scroll commands.

### Recalculation Engine

- Dirty flag mechanism for tracking updates.
- Topological sorting to determine update order.
- Selective recalculation based on dependencies.

### Error Handling

- Invalid syntax detection.
- Circular reference prevention.
- Graceful handling of undefined operations (e.g., `A1=10/0`).
